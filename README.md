# Social Media Analysis Project  
Welcome to the **Social Media Analysis Project** repository! This project focuses on analyzing social media data from **Reddit** by scraping data using the **Reddit API**. Using Python and Power BI, we clean, analyze, and visualize the data to uncover trends, user behavior, and engagement patterns.

## üöÄ Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to analyze Reddit data to understand:  
- **Trending topics and keywords.**  
- **User engagement metrics (upvotes, downvotes, comments).**  
- **Sentiment analysis of posts and comments.**  
- **Popularity of posts based on score (upvotes - downvotes).**  
- **Comparative analysis of different subreddits.**  

This analysis helps in understanding what content resonates with users and how trends evolve over time on Reddit.
